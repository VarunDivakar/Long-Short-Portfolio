Long Short Portfolio Optimization using Machine Learning

This Project does not require any data sets or .csv files to run, as all data is obtained dynamically during the execution of the Notebook.


In this Project I have used the following libraries:

pandas, numpy, matplotlib, talib, nsepy, datetime, and sklearn

The project follows the below mentioned procedure:

Section 1: Import Libraries and Data
Section 2: Check data visually and mathematically for consistency
Section 3: Data Preprocessing
Section 4: Creating Functions to generate Signals( target variables) and Indicators (Features)
Section 5: Standardize and Scale the data and Justify the approach adopted
Section 6: Train the different Classifier algorithms from an ensemble to choose the best performer from the validation set
Section 7: Train the classifier using Randomized search to get an intuition about the optimization parameters
Section 8: Use GridSearch to perform a thorough search in the vicinity of the best results obtained in step 7
Section 9: Print the accuracy score to verify if the results are consistent in train, test and validation data
Section 10: Repeat Process 6-9 for predicting a different target variable on same stock data
Section 11: Perform Backtesting and plot the results to see the performance of the algorithm
Section 12. Perform Step 1 to Step 11 for another stock in the portfolio
Section 13: Combine all the predictions and create the Long Short portfolio
Section 14: Plot the portfolio performance with respect to the base case portfolio
Section 15: Justifying the results and explaining the choices made for the stocks
Section 16: Detail the future course of action and any further improvements
